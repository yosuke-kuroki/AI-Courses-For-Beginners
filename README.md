# AI courses for beginners

## 1. Linear Regression

- [Linear regression](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/linear-regression)
  is a statistical technique used to find the relationship between variables. In an ML context, linear regression finds the relationship between features and a label.

- [Loss](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/linear-regression/loss)

- [Gradient Descent](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/linear-regression/gradient-descent)

- [Hyperparameters](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/linear-regression/hyperparameters)

## 2. Logistic Regression

- This module introduces a new type of regression model called [logistic regression](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/logistic-regression) that is designed to predict the probability of a given outcome.

## 3. Classification

- [Classification](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification) is the task of predicting which of a set of classes (categories) an example belongs to. In this module, you'll learn how to convert a logistic regression model that predicts a probability into a binary classification model that predicts one of two classes. You'll also learn how to choose and calculate appropriate metrics to evaluate the quality of a classification model's predictions. Finally, you'll get a brief introduction to multi-class classification problems, which are discussed in more depth later in the course.

## 3. Decision Trees

- [Decision Trees](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification) are versatile Machine Learning algorithms that can per‚Äê
  form both classification and regression tasks, and even multioutput tasks
