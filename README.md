# AI courses for beginners

## 1. Linear Regression

- [Linear regression](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/linear-regression)
  is a statistical technique used to find the relationship between variables. In an ML context, linear regression finds the relationship between features and a label.

- [Loss](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/linear-regression/loss)

- [Gradient Descent](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/linear-regression/gradient-descent)

- [Hyperparameters](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/linear-regression/hyperparameters)

## 2. Logistic Regression

- This module introduces a new type of regression model called [logistic regression](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/logistic-regression) that is designed to predict the probability of a given outcome.

## 3. Classification

- [Classification](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification) is the task of predicting which of a set of classes (categories) an example belongs to. In this module, you'll learn how to convert a logistic regression model that predicts a probability into a binary classification model that predicts one of two classes. You'll also learn how to choose and calculate appropriate metrics to evaluate the quality of a classification model's predictions. Finally, you'll get a brief introduction to multi-class classification problems, which are discussed in more depth later in the course.

## 4. Decision Trees

- [Decision Trees](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification) are versatile Machine Learning algorithms that can per‐
  form both classification and regression tasks, and even multioutput tasks

## 5. SVM(Support Vector Machine Algorithm)

- [Support Vector Machine(SVM)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/support-vector-machine-algorithm/) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It tries to find the best boundary known as hyperplane that separates different classes in the data. It is useful when you want to do binary classification like spam vs. not spam or cat vs. dog.

## 6. K means Clustering

- [K-Means Clustering](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-means-clustering-introduction/) is an Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm which groups unlabeled dataset into different clusters. It is used to organize data into groups based on their similarity.

## 7. PCA(Principal Componenet Analysis)

- [PCA](https://drlee.io/secrets-of-pca-a-comprehensive-guide-to-principal-component-analysis-with-python-and-colab-6f7f3142e721) is not just a mathematical technique; it’s a gateway to a more profound understanding of data, revealing patterns and relationships that might otherwise go unnoticed.

## 8. Rainforcement Learning

[Reinforcement Learning (RL)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/what-is-reinforcement-learning/) is a branch of machine learning that focuses on how agents can learn to make decisions through trial and error to maximize cumulative rewards.
